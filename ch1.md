Say 'cols' is the number of columns of the table.
and 'rows' is the number of columns of the table.
I would create an array of size cols * rows.
Then to access an element of index (i, j),
I would access array element (i*cols) + j.

# 4.
To modify a private variable/attribute of another class,
once can use abstractions in the form of getter and setter methods.
These are both public methods.
The getter returns the private variable to be 'gotten'.
The setter takes in a new value of the private attribute to set.

a. The land in a residential subdivision -> space-multiplexed in that the land is divided amongst different ownvers but time multiplexed in that different people may own the land across time
b. A personal computer -> hardware such as the main memory are space multiplexed but the cpu is time-multiplexed
c. A whiteboard in a classroom -> time-multiplexed by different teachers for the most part
d. A bench seat on a bus -> space-multiplexed
e. A single-user file in UNIX -> time-multiplexed
f. A printer on a timesharing system -> time-multiplexed
g. The heap in the C/C++ runtime system -> space-multiplexed (I think)

This would only be possible if the CPU is constantly being used by one of the processes, and at the same time all the other processes are doing operations that do not involve the CPU such as I/O.

- Batch processing is preffered when a large number of tasks that do not require human intervention must be completed.
- Time-sharing is preffered when multiple people need to be able to use one computer at the same time.

# 10.
- A batch processing processor scheduler prioritizes completing the totality of all batch jobs in the shortest amount of time possible.
- A timesharing processor scheduler prioritizes response time to the individual users.

# 11.
- Each of these operating systems utilize a different subset of the WIN32 system call API.
